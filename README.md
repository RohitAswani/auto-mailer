# Email Automation Script for Job Applications

This Python script automates the process of sending personalized job application emails to multiple recipients. It reads email addresses and names from a CSV file, composes a personalized email, and sends it to each recipient. The script also attaches your resume to the email.

## Features:
- Sends personalized emails to a list of recipients from a CSV file.
- Attaches a PDF resume to each email.
- Uses Gmail's SMTP server for sending emails.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Gmail account (with App Password enabled for authentication)
- `recipients.csv` file containing the recipient names and email addresses.
- Your resume in PDF format (or any other supported format).

## Prerequisites:
1. **Enable App Password in Gmail**:
   - Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/).
   - Enable 2-Step Verification.
   - Create an **App Password** for your email application. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device, then name it (e.g., "Python Script").
   - Copy the generated App Password and use it in the script.

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   - No external libraries are required for this script, as it uses built-in Python modules such as `smtplib`, `csv`, and `email`.
   
## Setup and Usage:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files
1. **Create a CSV File (`**recipients.csv**`)**:
   - The CSV file should have the following format:
   
   ```csv
   Name,Email
   User1,user1@gmail.com
   User2,user2@gmail.com

Each row should contain the recipient's name and email address.

Place Your Resume:

Place your resume in PDF format in the same directory as the script. The file should be named **resume.pdf** (you can change the name in the script if needed).

Step 2: Configure the Script
Open the script mailer.py in a text editor.

Replace the following variables with your Gmail credentials and App Password:

sender_email: Your Gmail email address.

app_password: The App Password you generated in Step 1.

Ensure your resume's filename is correct in resume_path (if not resume.pdf).

Step 3: Run the Script
Place mailer.py, recipients.csv, and resume.pdf in the same directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.

Run the script using Python 3:
python3 mailer.py

Step 4: Check Email Delivery
After running the script, it will send personalized emails to all recipients listed in recipients.csv with your resume attached.

The terminal will show a success or failure message for each email sent.

Troubleshooting:
FileNotFoundError: Ensure that the recipients.csv and resume.pdf are in the same directory as the script.

App Password Error: Double-check that youâ€™ve generated the correct App Password for your Gmail account and that 2-Step Verification is enabled.

Notes:
The script uses Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com) with port 587.

If you plan to send a large number of emails, consider using an email service like SendGrid to avoid Gmail's sending limits.
